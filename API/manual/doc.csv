    client-server architecture

web application is 3 tier application
1. we have the client application
2. application server[business logic]
3. database server

API is a way of communicating betweeen to application

Two types of API
SOAP - old technology , supports on XML
REST - support JSON,XML, html 


API in the net = Web service
NB - webservices are API but API are not web service

types of http HTTP request method 
GET - retrieves data from a database/server
POST - to create data to the database/server
PUT - to do largely Update data ....
PATCH - To  slightly Update data 
DELETE - To delete data in the database

WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE TESTING THE API

1.You have to know the functionality of the API,what it does
2. The request
3. The response
4.the content of the response 
5. the status code

WHAT IS IS HTTP

Summarily - a communication protocol betweeen client and server
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents,
such as HTML, between web browsers and web servers1. HTTP has different versions, such as HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, which have different features and performance
 
 some def .
URI - Uniform resource idenfier same as URL
URL - Uniform resource locator e.g https://www.google.com/articles/articlename
URN - Uniform resource name    e.g articlename
ENDPOINT - articles/articlename
host - e.g https://www.google.com/

N.B resource is something available in the server which we can requested. it 
    synonymous to a feature(for manual testing)
Payload - data we are sending in the request or data in the response

Collections contains folders and http request

On the point , what follows after question mark is called query parameter e.g 
"/payment-report?filter={"prlCreatedAt_start": "2023-01-21 00:00:00","prlCreatedAt_end": "2023-04-21 23:59:59"}"

path parameter e.g 91c5f2da-ca9c-455f-be2e-50784051b4d7/pay
